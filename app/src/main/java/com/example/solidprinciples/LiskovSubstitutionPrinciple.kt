/*
We should be able to use subclasses instead of the parent classes which class they have
extended, without the need to make any changes in our code. In simple words, the child class must be
substitutable for the parent class.
Since child classes extended from the parent classes, they inherit their behavior.
If child classes can not perform the behaviors belonging to the parent classes, probably, we wonâ€™t
 write any code in the method that does the behavior or we will throw an error when objects want to
  use it. But these actions cause code pollution and unnecessary code crowds.
